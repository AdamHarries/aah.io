This is the web based CV & musings of me, Adam Harries.

I'm a recent Comp-sci graduate of Durham University, currently studying for a PhD in Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, as part of the Pervasive Parallelism EPSRC CDT.

This site, though bare bones at the moment, should hopefully chronicle some of my findings/work as part of that, and any other computer related thoughs I have as well.

I'm reachable by email at harries.adam@gmail.com
