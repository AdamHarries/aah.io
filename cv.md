# Research Interests

We've reached the end of the single threaded "moore's law" era, and the multicore age is looming. Highly parallel processing is the future, but still presents a huge challenge for the average programmer.

I'm interested in how we can expose the present, and upcoming parallelism to non-specialist programmers. In particular, I'm interested in how we can do this *transparently*, thus providing parallelism "for free" without any significant implementation differences to non-parallel programming. 

<!-- I believe in doing this through using functional and pattern based languages etc etc.-->

# Education

- Currently studying for a combined Masters and PhD as part of the Pervasive Parallelism CDT, funded by the EPSRC
- Supervised by Christophe Dubach and Murray Cole
- Master's thesis currently titled: "Skeletal Approaches to Sparse Linear Algebra for Graph Applications on GPUs"

## 2011-2014 BSc Computer Science, Durham University

- Graduated with a 1st class honours in a B.Sc in Computer science
- Awarded the "Morgan Stanley" prize in first year for outstanding academic performance
- Awarded the ARM prize in final year for best marks in the module "Advanced Computer Systems"

# Employment 

## Undergraduate Research Intern, Ordered Universe Project, Durham University, Summer 2013

- Worked as part of an interdisciplinary collaboration between the History and Computer Science departments to produce a 3D animation describing the start of the universe, as described by the 12th century Bishop Robert Grosseteste.
- Primarily used Maya and ffmpeg to produce the animation, although as my work was very self directed I explored other possible solutions including writing a custom ray tracer.
- Worked in a very self-directed manner, with little contact with my Computer Science supervisor, and only weekly contact with my supervisor in the History department. Helped further develop my planning, researching and timekeeping skills.

##Â Software Development Intern, British Airways, Summer 2012

- Worked independently within the Flight Ops team to produce software to track planned outages affecting the team and teams depending on them.
- Used Java to produce a software client using Apache HWPF to parse the outage bulletin, and XML to store configuration options.
- Independently started, managed and completed the project, using a waterfall methodology with aspects of agile for the final stages of development.
- Improved team efficiency - turned a daily 1 hour task (per team member), and 2 a weekly 2 hour task (per team) into a daily five minute task.

# Technical skills

## Programming and toolkits

- Strong C, Python and Haskell programmer, as well as confident in writing code in C++, Java and Scala
- Strong knowledge of the CUDA GPU programming toolkit and language, as well as experience with the OpenCL programming toolkit.
- Limited experience with modelchecking software such as NuSMV, and computer aided proof systems such as Isabelle.
- Some experience with data analysis using the Python libraries Numpy, Matplotlib and Networkx.

## Other computing experience

- Day to day user of GNU/Linux (specifically Arch Linux & Ubuntu), and confident with normal system administration tasks, as well as configuring most parts of a Linux installation. I am also a regular user of both OSX and Windows.
- Strong experience using LaTeX, including the beamer library, Tikz and PGFplots.
