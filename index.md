Or, Adam's online babblings. This is the personal site of Adam Harries - a student and sometimes programmer from the UK. I'm a recent graduate of Durham University, where I studied Computer Science. I'm currently studying for a PhD in Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, as part of the Pervasive Parallelism EPSRC CDT. 

##Research Interests

I'm interested in how we can make modern programming languages as fast as possible on modern hardware. I'm particularly interested in the implementation of high level, skeletal and functional languages, especially in how we can get them to run efficiently on all sorts of hardware.

##Contact me

I'm reachable by email at either harries.adam@gmail.com (personal), or adam.harries@inf.ed.ac.uk (work). Send me cool stuff, or drop me a line if you're interested in similar things to me! If you want to send me encrypted email (gmail only at present), my PGP key is available [here](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x948B2C500081A3C4), or [here](Link to local PGP key).

##Around the web

As for the rest of the web, I've got a twitter with even more inane ramblings, @harriesadam, a github account with most of my code in it, [AdamHarries](https://github.com/AdamHarries), and a bitbucket with the rest, [AdamHarries](https://bitbucket.org/AdamHarries) (again).
