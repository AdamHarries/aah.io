	Hi! This is the personal site of Adam Harries - a student and sometimes programmer from the UK. This site contains my thoughts on computers, maths, and the world around me, as well as links to some of the projects and programming that I'm most proud of.

	I'm also accessible in a couple of other places around the web:<br/>
