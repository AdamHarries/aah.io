#A short test for mathjax

This file is just a short test to make sure that mathjax is installed correctly!

$$ \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \binom{n}{k} $$


$$
A_{m,n} =
 \begin{pmatrix}
  a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \cdots & a_{1,n} \\
  a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \cdots & a_{2,n} \\
  \vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
  a_{m,1} & a_{m,2} & \cdots & a_{m,n}
 \end{pmatrix}
$$

How does inline maths work? Does it work here ($z=x^{y+2}$) for example?
