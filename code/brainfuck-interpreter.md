title: Brainfuck Interpreter
---

I got bored in a particularly tedious rehearsal one day, and decided to write an interpreter/virtual machine for the language [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck). While writing an interpreter for it wasn't particularly hard, and the code isn't particularly lightweight or clever I thought I'd post it here anyway.
