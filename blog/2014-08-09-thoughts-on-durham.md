Thoughts on Durham university as a recently graduated student.

As a recent graduate of Durham University, my experiences and thoughts on the institution and its people are still very fresh and raw. I thought I'd better get my thoughts about my experience down in code, before it all leaves me. Durham is a very interesting university, with manny different and contrasting aspects. To try and tackle this, I've split my thoughts on it into a number of sections:

- Firstly, the collegiate system, and more specifically, my college (Trevelyan)
- Secondly, the other students, in a very general and stereotyping way.
- Thirdly, the academic departments, and in particular the Engineering and Computing Sciences department, within which I studied.
- Penultimately, the students union, known colloquially as the DSU, but which insists on being called "Durham SU".
- Finally, my experience of the university as a whole, taking into account my thoughts on each of its aspects.

If you're interested in any particular section, and want to skip there, feel free to follow one of the following links:

In this post I'm going to try and be as critical as possible of parts of the university I disliked, and praise the parts I thought were good as much as I can. This may end up with a slightly disjointed feel to the post, but I think it's important to try and highlight areas for improvement, while still 

##Colleges

- amazing
- the reason I came
- second layer of interaction after university stuff
- allows for friends outside of subjects/interests
- sometimes stops people from doing uni stuff
- sometimes enhances it
- good support
- very friendly
- food?

##Other Students

- posh
- depends on where you meet them
	- on a night out, they'll be posh
	- at a society, will be more friendly
	- in college, easy to gravitate to group of like minds
- can be somewhat disinterested
- small core of very active students - rest can be slightly apathetic

##Departments

- mine was great
- but great variety
- some (e.g. physics) can be less helpful
- however, college support is still there

##The Students Union

-absolute travesty

##The University

- different, but good
