> I would love to see a related major or a two-track computer science program. A lot of classes could be shared between these programs (e.g. discrete math, data structures, algorithms), but they could start to diverge in areas relevant to what they want to do when they graduate. The academic/theory/whatever track could include more math and more electives that depend on that math. The industry/applications/whatever track could include more training in practical applications related to software engineering in industry. Some schools already do this with a software engineering major or something similar, but it doesnâ€™t seem to be a widespread phenomenon.
